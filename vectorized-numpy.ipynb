    "# Vectorized Calculation Using Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Although Numpy is a Python package, it was not developed in Python. Rather, it is written mostly in C and consists of binary executables compiled from source code. Numpy functions are therefore generally significantly faster than the same operations performed in Python. The term \"vectorized operation\" refers to passing an entire Numpy array of known data type to an optimized, compiled C code. The example below shows a simple calculation of a harmonic function using vectorized operations compared with the same operation in a Python loop. The vectorized calculation is much faster."
